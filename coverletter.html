	<p class="entry">To whom it may concern,</p>
	
		<p>I was excited to learn of the junior web developer position that recently became available at your company and am hopeful to be invited to interview for said position. As most of my work in development is done for my business or for fun, I'm keen to be in an environment that allows me to broaden my horizons and work on projects that aren't my own.</p> 

		<p>Professionally, my history has revolved around the customer service industry - specifically in management and sales. I currently own my own business contracting live music (performed by myself) with many locations in Southern Maine. Just about all of my responsibilities involve marketing myself correctly. Regular activity on social media on or via my own website is important in engaging my fans and potential clients.</p> 

		<p>I developed my own WordPress theme to accommodate my professional needs and have made a number of updates to it as those needs have changed. Manipulating custom loops, post types, taxonomies, and fields have helped me create a useful site that allows me to post all of my upcoming performances in a specific format and share them on social media effortlessly.</p>

		<p>As a hobbyist, I've built a number of simple web apps and smaller sites with PHP. I believe that using PHP outside of and/or prior to developing with WordPress is invaluable. The understanding gained by building projects without a CMS, libraries, or other tools that make the developing process faster or more efficient ends up being beneficial to developing with those tools ultimately. Much of the custom functionality on my site would've been difficult to achieve without a foundation in PHP.</p>

		<p>In addition to this experience, I'm comfortable working with HTML, CSS, SASS, and MySQL.</p>

		<p>I'm confident that I can offer the desire to grow, the ability to work with others, and the development skills necessary to succeed at this position. Thank you for your time, I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity!</p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>
