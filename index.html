	<p class="entry">Paul Van Savage,</p>
	
		<p>I was excited to learn of the Photographer position that recently became available in your News Department and am hopeful to be invited to interview for said position. As most of my work in photography is done for my business or for fun, I'm keen to be in an environment that allows me to broaden my horizons and work on new projects.</p> 

		<p>Professionally, my history has revolved around the customer service industry - specifically in management and sales. I currently own my own business contracting live music (performed by myself) with many locations in Southern Maine. Just about all of my responsibilities involve marketing myself correctly. Regular activity on social media on or via my own website is important in engaging my fans and potential clients.</p> 

		<p>I thoroughly enjoy photography. I picked it up as a hobby and it's certainly grown from there. I often do promo photos for bands or soloists, I'm very involved in the Maine music scene. Aside from portraiture, I also find a lot of my interests lay in landscape and nightscape photography. Challenging conditions I find to be the most rewarding when trying to capture a moment just right.</p>

		<p>Post-production, in my opinion, is just as important as pressing the shutter button on your camera. I'm comfortable working in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom - they are staple programs in my production process. My take on post-production in most cases is to keep the photograph true to itself. Adjusting your exposure and white balance in order to make your digital photo retain life-like detail. My favorite edits are the ones that don't look over-processed.</p>

		<p>I'm confident that I can offer the desire to grow, the ability to meet deadlines, a self-motivated and driven attitude, and the photography skills necessary to succeed at this position. Thank you for your time, I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity!</p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>
